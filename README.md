# Spotify Daily Listens

A basic data pipeline done in python that downloads my Spotify data (songs played in the last 24 hours) and saves to a PostgreSQL database. 

## To Do

- Set up Docker to host Airflow.
- Schedule pipeline to run daily.
- Flesh out README to detail Architecture, ETL Flow, and Setup.
